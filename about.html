          <h1>Who is MCdev92?</h1>
          <p class="bio-c">Born and raised in the Dominican Republic. I migrated to the United states in 2010,
             immidiately after graduating form high school. I enrolled in college in Hayward, California but
             because economic circumstances, I took a break from school to start a small trucking business, 
             everything was going well but I knew I had to go back to school to pursue a career in technology. I love working with computers!.
             <br></br>
             I went back to school while working full-time as a business owner but short after, COVID-19 hit and diesel prices sky-rocketed.
              I decided to sell my business and focus in finishing school. 
              I am currently attending school full-time and polishing my coding skills on my spare time. 
              I decided to start my coding journey with the Odin Project. I am currently finishing with the foundation section
              and I am loving every part of it.
            <br></br>
            In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my family, working out, learning new skills and new technologies. I started learning C# and creating
            videogames but decided to take a break to dive into the world of web-design and learn html, css and javascript.</p>
